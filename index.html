      <h1>The Imbalance of Culture Fit</h1>
        <h2>by Matt Griggin</h2>
          <p>Part of getting to a better place in the new years is recognizing where we have sway, and
           going past our own discomfort to create positive change in ourselves and in the world.
           Those of us who have a role in the hiring process can do better by thinking critically bout
           culture fit. Matt Griffin challenges us to consider whether it actually creates the kind of
           team that's the best for the enterprise, or mostly serves to make us comfortable by
           surrounding us with people largly like ourselves in way that aren't relevant to the
           business.
